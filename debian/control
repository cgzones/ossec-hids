Description: Host based intrusion detection system
 OSSEC is a free, open-source host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS).
 It performs log analysis, integrity checking, Windows registry monitoring,
 rootkit detection, time-based alerting, and active response.
 It provides intrusion detection for most operating systems, including Linux,
 OpenBSD, FreeBSD, OS X, Solaris and Windows.
 OSSEC has a centralized, cross-platform architecture allowing multiple
 systems to be easily monitored and managed.
